What does the project do?
    the specific subreddit 'ProgrammingBuddies' is about finding partners to do programming activies with.
    my goal for this project is to post a comment of similar posts to a post(if there are any) on the post, for each new post.
    this could  clean up the subreddit from redundant posts, and connect users together.
